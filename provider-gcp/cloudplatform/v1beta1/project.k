        The alphanumeric ID of the billing account this project
        belongs to.user) on the billing account.
        See Google Cloud Billing API Access Control
        for more details.
    deletionPolicy : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The deletion policy for the Project. Setting ABANDON allows the resource
        to be abandoned rather than deleted, i.e. Possible values are: "PREVENT", "ABANDON", "DELETE". Default value is DELETE.
    effectiveLabels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        effective labels
    folderId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The numeric ID of the folder this project should be
        created under. Only one of org_id or folder_id may be
        specified. If the folder_id is specified, then the project is
        created under the specified folder. Changing this forces the
        project to be migrated to the newly specified folder.
    id : str, default is Undefined, optional
        an identifier for the resource with format projects/{{project}}
    labels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        A set of key/value label pairs to assign to the project.
        Note: This field is non-authoritative, and will only manage the labels present in your configuration.
        Please refer to the field 'effective_labels' for all of the labels present on the resource.
    name : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The display name of the project.
    number : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The numeric identifier of the project.
    orgId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The numeric ID of the organization this project belongs to.
        Changing this forces a new project to be created.  Only one of
        org_id or folder_id may be specified. If the org_id is
        specified then the project is created at the top level. Changing
        this forces the project to be migrated to the newly specified
        organization.
        The numeric ID of the organization this project belongs to.
    projectId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The project ID. Changing this forces a new project to be created.
    skipDelete : bool, default is Undefined, optional
        skip_delete is deprecated and will be
        removed in 6.0.0. Please use deletion_policy instead. A skip_delete value of false
        can be changed to a deletion_policy value of DELETE and a skip_delete value of true
        to a deletion_policy value of ABANDON for equivalent behavior.
    terraformLabels : {str:str}, default is Undefined, optional
        The combination of labels configured directly on the resource and default labels configured on the provider.
