    ----------
    description : str, default is Undefined, optional
        A description of the rule. Changing this creates a new security group rule.
    direction : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The direction of the rule, valid values are ingress
        or egress. Changing this creates a new security group rule.
    ethertype : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The layer 3 protocol type, valid values are IPv4
        or IPv6. Changing this creates a new security group rule.
    id : str, default is Undefined, optional
        id
    portRangeMax : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The higher part of the allowed port range, valid
        integer value needs to be between 1 and 65535. Changing this creates a new
        security group rule.
    portRangeMin : float, default is Undefined, optional
        The lower part of the allowed port range, valid
        integer value needs to be between 1 and 65535. Changing this creates a new
        security group rule.
    $protocol : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The layer 4 protocol type, valid values are
        following. Changing this creates a new security group rule. This is required
        if you want to specify a port range.
    region : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The region in which to obtain the V2 networking client.
        A networking client is needed to create a port. If omitted, the
        region argument of the provider is used. Changing this creates a new
        security group rule.
    remoteAddressGroupId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The remote address group id, the value
        needs to be an OpenStack ID of an address group in the same tenant. Changing
        this creates a new security group rule. This argument is mutually exclusive
        with remote_ip_prefix and remote_group_id.
    remoteGroupId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The remote group id, the value needs to be an
        Openstack ID of a security group in the same tenant. Changing this creates
        a new security group rule.
    remoteIpPrefix : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The remote CIDR, the value needs to be a valid
        CIDR (i.e. 192.168.0.0/16). Changing this creates a new security group rule.
    securityGroupId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The security group id the rule should belong
        to, the value needs to be an Openstack ID of a security group in the same
        tenant. Changing this creates a new security group rule.
    tenantId : str, default is Undefined, optional
        The owner of the security group. Required if admin
        wants to create a port for another tenant. Changing this creates a new
        security group rule.
